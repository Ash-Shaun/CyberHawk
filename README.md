# CyberHawk : Anti-Theft Application for Windows Laptops
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ash-Shaun/CyberHawk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ash-Shaun/CyberHawk)

Laptops change the ways of communication, it provides an advantage of communicating with anyone virtually through video conferencing, email, etc., and it also provides a facility to store contact numbers, email idâ€™s, in memory which reduces the concept of File-System to store personal information. Company related information and documents can be viewed anywhere and can be shared with anyone. Because of its <b>light weight</b> and <b>small size</b>, it can be stolen very easily and the confidential-information of any organization or personal details of people stored in the phone memory can be easily exposed. My project's aim is to put forward a technique through which the thief, who steals any laptop installed with <i>CyberHawk</i>, gets captured and the user can make him/her stop misusing any confidential information. This application includes Socket communication, Reverse TCP where you can send video clips and photos to  owner even under a firewall, unlike Email which includes only text. It gives the information about the thief by sending the snapshots and a small video clip of the thief to an alternate account, which helps us to recognize the thief.
