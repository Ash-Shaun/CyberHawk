# CyberHawk : Anti-Theft Application for Windows Laptops

Laptops change the ways of communication, it provides an advantage of communicating with anyone virtually through video conferencing, email, etc., and it also provides a facility to store contact numbers, email idâ€™s, in memory which reduces the concept of File-System to store personal information. Company related information and documents can be viewed anywhere and can be shared with anyone. Because of its light weight and small size, it can be stolen very easily and the confidential-information of any organization or personal details of people stored in the phone memory can be easily exposed. My project's aim is to put forward a technique through which the thief, who steals any laptop installed with CyberHawk, gets captured and the user can make him/her stop misusing any confidential information. This application includes Socket communication, Reverse TCP where you can send video clips and photos to  owner even under a firewall, unlike Email which includes only text. It gives the information about the thief by sending the snapshots and a small video clip of the thief to an alternate account, which helps us to recognize the thief.
